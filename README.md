# ShelterLink

This repository contains the source code for **ShelterLink**, a web app that lets shelters post real-time needs and enables donors to match those needs with items they already have.

## Features

- **Shelter posts:**  
  Homeless shelter representatives can create posts listing current needs.

- **Authentication & profiles:**  
  A login system for both donors and shelters, with user profiles showing:
  - For donors: donation history and items they can donate.
  - For shelters: requests theyâ€™ve created and fulfilled.
  
- **Donor posts:**  
  Donors can publish posts describing supplies they can donate, which can be matched to shelter requests.

- **Matching system:**  
  Automatic matching between shelter needs and donor offerings when items align.  
  Email confirmations are sent to both the shelter and the donor once a match is made.
