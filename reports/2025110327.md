# Team Status Report

## 1. Team Report

### A. Last Week's Goals
- Revise the Testing and CI doc. Will complete the request/donation form page and help with the backend registration/form logic if needed. 
- Work on saving the request / donation form, completing the system design section and extending our testing plan.
- Connect registration / login information / requests form with database
- Create function to save registration information
- Complete the dashboard page, connecting to the backend database to frontend.

### B. Progress and Issues
- Fixed bugs in the frontend. Resolved race condition
- Basic matching algorithm set up
- Created mock data to assure functionality during beta release presentation. Made mock data, donations, matches, requests
- Connected backend registration / login information / requests form to the database
- Overall: ready for beta release, behind on our timeline


### C. Plans and Goals for the Next Week
- Adding complexity to the matching algorithm, with more matching conditions and tie-breaking matches when possible
- Each team member will make a PR soon and reviews another PR 
- Vector database functionality: usage, vector retrieval etc


## 2. Contributions of Individual Team Members

### A. Last Week's Goals
- **Fernando Pazaran:** Will create and complete the profile page on the frontend by Friday (starting stretch goals). Will also help connect the database to backend logic if help is needed.
- **Gianna Carlson:** Will work on creating the basic matching algorithm for the backend, having it ready by Sunday. Revise sections of the living document.
- **Alex(Xinlei) Liu:** Will work on connecting the registration form, login information, and donation/request forms with the database, having it ready by Sunday. 
- **Charles Zhou:** Will work on sending back information to the front end, so when the front end sends the user id, the back end will send back username and usertype(donor/shelter). Will have it ready by Sunday.
- **Justin Huynh:** Will create the “shelters near me” page, and will have researched the api needed for this by Sunday.

### B. Progress and Issues
- Issue: We did not get as much done as we wanted to in preparation for the live demo/presentation. To elaborate, we were making sure everything was running smoothly and fixing bugs that we encountered.
- **Fernando Pazaran:** Connected the database to the backend registration logic, and user info logic. Resolved race conditions in the dashboard page that caused user info to not be retrieved after registering. Finished the mock functionality of the app.
- **Gianna Carlson:** Created the basic matching algorithm for the backend. Edited living document based on TA feedback and made the beta release presentation slides.
- **Alex(Xinlei) Liu:** Connecting backend to database and attempting to setup vector data retrieval from LLM and matching; vector database and vector based matching not implemented yet (will not be on the demo) 
- **Charles Zhou:** Worked on sending information back to the frontend when the frontend sends the user id.
- **Justin Huynh:** Worked on researching the location api for the shelters near me feature did not deploy due to beta release

### C. Plans and Goals for the Next Week
- **Fernando Pazaran:**  Create and complete the profile page on the frontend by Friday. Help implement donation/request submissions in the backend by Monday.
- **Gianna Carlson:** Will work on creating a more complex matching algorithm. Matching based on keyword descriptions and tie-breaking multiple matches by choosing to match with the earliest request form. Will have it done by Sunday.
- **Alex(Xinlei) Liu:** Finishing vector retrieval from LLM, storage of vectors into databases and using vectors for more advanced matching algorithms, having it ready by Sunday.
- **Charles Zhou:** Will work on testing the backend, having it done by Sunday.
- **Justin Huynh:** Create a PR for the shelters near me and test out the api for location by Sunday.
