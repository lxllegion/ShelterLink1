# ShelterLink User Manual

## High Level Description

ShelterLink is a web application designed to connect donors with homeless shelters in need of particular resources. This system helps bridge the gap between people that want to donate resources and the shelters that require them.

### What the system does:
- Allows shelters to create posts to request supplies under several general categories including food, medical supplies, and clothing.
- Allows donors to make respective posts detailing the resources that are available for them to donate to these shelters.
- Automatically matches donations and requests based on supply category, amount, and location to help shelters.

### Why use ShelterLink?
- A user may be interested in using ShelterLink to help shelters keep a running supply of important resources to serve their audience.
- It also simplifies the process of finding a homeless shelter in need.
