# Coding Guidelines
**Python**: https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html <br>
**Typescript**: https://google.github.io/styleguide/tsguide.html <br>

We chose to implement the Google style guidelines for Python, and Typescript in order for consistent code quality across the various programming languages we are using. By choosing guidelines from Google, this ensures uniformity and efficient maintenance of our code across the team. We plan to enforce these code quality guidelines by going over these guidelines as a team, and using a linter. <br>

For PostgresSQL, we chose to implement the Bytebase style guideline for our project. This website has clear formatting guidelines and an easy to access table of contents. We plan to enforce the guidelines of this style guide by reviewing the guide as a team, and using a linter.
